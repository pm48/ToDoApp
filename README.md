This is an Android demo application for Creating a ToDo App.
Time spent: 5 hours.
It allows the user to:
1. Add an item to the to-do list displayed.
2. Remove an item.
3. Edit the item. A new screen activity will be displayed for editing the item.
The original to do list is updated after the new activity edits the item and sends it back via intent.
